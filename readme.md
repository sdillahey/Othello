A description of your game. Background info of the game and screenshots are a nice touch.

## Rules of the Game:
The object of Othello is to finish the game with more pieces on the board than your opponent. To do this, you and your opponent take turns placing your respectively colored pieces on the board. After you place your piece, any of your opponent's pieces that are directly between the piece you played and your other pieces gets flipped. You can flip along horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. For a move to be legal, you must be able to flip at least one piece. If you are unable to make a move, play continues on with your opponents move. If neither of you can make a move, the game is over.
