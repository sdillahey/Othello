# Othello
## A Two-Player Strategy Game
Tasked with programming a game, my mind instantly turned to one of my favorite two player board games - Othello. The rules of the game are simple, but a superior strategy is required to outflank your opponent. You may recognize Othello by it's classic black and white style, or perhaps by the name Reversi, but I decided to revamp it to a more modern, colorful version while keeping its minimalist design.

## Rules of the Game:
The object of Othello is to finish the game with more pieces on the board than your opponent. To do this, you and your opponent take turns placing your respective colored pieces on the board. After you place your piece, any of your opponent's pieces that are directly between the piece you played and your other pieces get flipped. You can flip along any of the horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. For a move to be legal, you must be able to flip at least one piece. If you are unable to make a move, you must skip your turn and play continues on with your opponent's move. If neither player can make a move, the game is over and the player with the most pieces on the board wins.
